## 25 July 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal website launched 

As I have been learning Python recently, launching a personal website seems a natural next step. It is a good idea to have a dedicated personal website so that all the things I have written (eg journal papers, articles, etc) can be found in one place. I used Azure previously, but felt that it was too much for maintaining a simple website. Other choices, such as hosting it on Google Compute, or Google Drive, do not seem ideal either. Finally, I read in a comment on a YouTube video that you can use github to host a website. Started learning how to do it from yesterday and launched this site today. Over the next few weeks, I will add more contents to this site in the next few weeks (lots of things to learn), and post blogs from time to time.
