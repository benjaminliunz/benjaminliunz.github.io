## 29 July 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Five Levels of Communication

In the past several years, I have been trying to understand how artificial intelligence works, why sometimes they make wrong decisions, and how we should regulate artificial intelligence. This work has led me to think more about how the human brain works. 

Most modern AI applications rely on machine learning. A computer gets training data from the outside world, and uses algorithms to make decisions. If the training data is incorrect, or there are some problems with the algorithms, then the decisions made by the computer will be wrong. In many ways, a human mind is very similar to a computer: books, lectures, and life experiences etc are our training data, and we have certain algorithms to make decisions. Sometimes the training data is wrong. Our algorithms are also full of problems (eg cognitive biases). 

Inspired by the analogy between computers and humans, I think communication occurs at different levels.

Level 1: At the most basic level, when A communicates with B, A is not aware of (or fails to take into account) B’s training data and algorithms. In daily lives, most conversations take place at this level: we simply say whatever is on our mind, without thinking about how the other person will interpret our message. As a result, very often miscommunications occur.  

Level 2: At this level, A considers B’s training data (eg B’s current knowledge). For example, when A explains to B how API works, A will explain first what API stands for if A knows that B does not know it yet. All teachers should be operating at this level at least.  

Level 3: At this level, A is aware of not only B’s lack of knowledge (ie data), but also B’s cognitive biases (eg algorithm flaws). For example, B is a flat-earther and A wants to persuade B that the Earth is actually round. Normally showing B a picture of the earth will do. But if B has a strong confirmation bias, then showing B pictures will not work, because B will simply choose to ignore the new evidence (believing that the pictures are fake). If A realises this, A will not engage with B on discussions about the earth unless A has found a way to address B’s confirmation bias.   
An ancient Chinese story illustrates this point well. Two men had an argument about what 3 times 7 is equal to: one says it is 21, the other 28. The first guy took the matter to the court. To his surprise, the judge punished him. The first guy says, “This is unfair. Why should I be punished when clearly the other guy is wrong?” The judge replied, “Well, you are arguing with a person who believes that the product of 3 and 7 is 28. You are wasting my time.”
The moral of the story: if you believe that the other person will not listen to you due to biases or whatever reason (eg being angry), you should disengage. Most disputes in marriage can be avoided if one party follows this rule. 

Level 4: While level 3 is useful, level 4 is the most important. I call this level “conversation with self.” That is, we need to know that we are all affected by incorrect training data and defective algorithms. In short, we could be the guy who believes 3 x 7 is 28! This is hard, particularly for older and supposedly more knowledgeable people because it is easier for them to find evidence to support their existing views. I must admit I am in this group.  

Level 5: At this level, we communicate with a higher being. We realise a much deeper and richer meaning of life. Throughout history, only a handful of people (such as Buddha) have ever reached this level. It is not something we are guaranteed to achieve no matter how hard we try, but surely worth striving for.
