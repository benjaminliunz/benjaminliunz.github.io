## 28 July 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tesla, Elon Musk, and AI

I bought a Model X in 2017. It was actually the first time ever I bought a new car. From a financial perspective, buying a new car is not a wise investment. But I managed to persuade myself into buying it on the basis that, as I was just starting to teach a course on AI and law, I needed to have first-hand experience on driverless cars. 

Now,  after three years, I must say I have no complaint. Of course I cannot take it on a long road trip (there are only a handful Superchargers in NZ), but I already knew that when I bought it. There are many benefits: no need to fill gas, water, or check engine oil. The only time I need to go to a gas station is when I need to fill air in the tires. Autopilot is quite useful when driving on motorways. I even booked the full-self-driving package in June, just before the price increase of $1k. 

Elon is a big believer in AI. He has got himself into trouble several times due to his views on when AGI will become reality. Some AI researchers say Elon knows very little about AI so his views are not reliable. But for laypeople like me, Elon has the most impressive record on many things. Therefore, it seems logical to believe that there is at least some truth there.  There will be an update on Neuralink’s progress next month. Something exciting may be happening…
