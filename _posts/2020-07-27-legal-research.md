## 27 July 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is Legal Research Useful?

As an academic, a big part of my job (almost 50%) is to write research articles and get them published. The number of publications is the primary factor to get promoted. Over the past 6-7 years since I joined academia, I did manage to get a number of articles published in academic journals. 

However, the more I think about this process, the less faith I have in it. It seems that, other than the author and the editors, the only people who read legal journal articles are those (legal researchers and law students) who need to write articles on the same topic. Those published articles have almost zero impact in the real world. Law-maker, policy-makers, and judges rarely refer to those articles. 

I doubt how much value there is in legal research. In other disciplines, such as physics and medicine, the field develops over time – old theories are proven to be wrong, and new ideas and technologies get implemented. But law seems different. Generations and generations of researchers talk about the same things again and again. An article published 50 years ago can be published in today’s journals with little changes. Put it in another way: a modern physicist or computer scientist can confidently say he knows more than his peers 50 years ago, but a legal researcher cannot make the same claim. In other words, legal science does not move forward. If this is true, what’s the point of doing traditional (ie theoretical and doctrinal) legal research?  

Realizing this leaves me little drive to continue to write more orthodox legal articles. Instead, I will only write articles (or do things) which I think can be useful in practice. At this stage, I am not sure what they are, but I hope I can find out in the next few weeks. In the meantime, learning more about data science will be a good idea.
